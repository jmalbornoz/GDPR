An example of a simple chatbot built with Langchain

In this notebook we explore how a RAG-powered chatbot can be used to interrogate part of the now defunct Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock. We use Falcon as our LLM of choice.

Download and unzip "text_file.zip", then upload it to your Colab environment once you fire up the notebook. 

You will also need a HuggingFace API key!
